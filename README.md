## Portfolio Optimization using the Markowitz Efficient Frontier
# Introduction
The Markowitz Efficient Frontier is a cornerstone of modern portfolio theory, enabling investors to construct portfolios that maximize expected returns for a given level of risk. This repository provides Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the calculation of the Efficient Frontier for portfolios comprising more than two assets (stocks).

# Key Features
  - Efficient Frontier Calculation: Explore how to compute the Efficient Frontier for portfolios with multiple assets, optimizing the trade-off between risk and return.
  
  - Visualization: Visualize the Efficient Frontier to identify optimal portfolios based on different risk-return profiles.
  
  - Risk-Return Analysis: Analyze the relationship between risk and expected return to inform portfolio diversification strategies.
  
  - Real Financial Data Examples: Implement examples using real-world financial data, offering practical insights into portfolio management.
  
  - Customizable Parameters: Adjust parameters such as the risk-free rate and target returns to tailor portfolio optimization to specific investment goals.
