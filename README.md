Portfolio Optimization using the Markowitz Efficient Frontier

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to calculate the Markowitz Efficient Frontier for a portfolio consisting of more than two types of assets (tickets).

Introduction

The Markowitz Efficient Frontier is a fundamental concept in modern portfolio theory. It represents the set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a given level of risk. By considering multiple assets, the efficient frontier allows investors to make more informed decisions about portfolio diversification and risk management.
